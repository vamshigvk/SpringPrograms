This project helps us to take input from webpages rather than console.
Do not forgot to add apache tomcat to java build path libraries.
If apache-tomcat server says cant be started. Goto D drive, search tmp0 folder and delete it, re install server on spring.
convert java project to maven and update maven project whenever required.
